# Purpose
The whole purpose of this is the ability to spin up a working development enviroment in seconds. As someone who has had to rebuild there system numerous times in the last year for one reason or another, it is quite nice to have one simple script that can handle the majority of this.

Things like the hotkeys, configurations, fonts etc are often a pain to maintain. Will be trying my best to keep this updated & leaving the majority of it optional.

# Installation

Should only need git, which would come with most ubuntu/gnome builds.

Clone the repo `https://github.com/matthewrobinsondev/ubuntu-dev-playbook.git`

Install `./install.sh`
